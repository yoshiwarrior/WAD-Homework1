As a proud Rustacean and Ferris the Crab adorer, I regret to inform you that your taste in languages sucks. This is sad. You can do better. You know how easy package and dependancy management is with Cargo? Not to mention you don’t even need a Makefile. It’s great. Dynamically typed languages need to die. There’s no other option. They just do. If you like dynamic typing, you need some help. Seriously. By using a dynamically typed and interpreted language (which means its @#*!&!@ slow!!!), you are committing genocide and harming the environment more than gas cars.",
